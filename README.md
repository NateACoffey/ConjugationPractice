# ConjugationPractice


Conjugation practice that I made to practice my Japanese conjugations

Uses console to input/output.

I made this because I couldn't find good conjugation quizes and realized that I can just make my own. Turns out doing QA is harder than the coding since I need to know the appropriate conjugations.

### Requirements:
* Japanese hiragana keyboard input

### Verb tenses include: 
* present polite
* present negative plain
* present negative polite
* past plain
* past polite
* past negative plain
* past negative polite
