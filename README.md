# ConjugationPractice


Conjugation practice that I made to practice my Japanese conjugations

I made this because I couldn't find good conjugation quizes and realized that I can just make my own. Turns out doing QA is harder than the coding since I need to know the appropriate conjugations.

I also added Spanish because why not.
